# Tutorial on mutational analysis

Alexander Goncearenco, 2020

Described in this tutorial: analysis of mutational processes with mutagene and analysis of mutated DDR genes.

There are two ways this tutorial can be used: with and without rerunning the analyses.

### Without rerunning the analyses:

1. Read the PDF file presentation [MutationalAnalysis-June2020.pdf](MutationalAnalysis-June2020.pdf)
2. Open and run [TCGA-COAD.ipynb](TCGA-COAD.ipynb)

### Rerunning the analyses:

1. Read the PDF file presentation [MutationalAnalysis-June2020.pdf](MutationalAnalysis-June2020.pdf)
2. Download necessary files from TCGA (described in the PDF)
3. Run mutagene packafge (described in the PDF)
4. Open and run [TCGA-COAD.ipynb](TCGA-COAD.ipynb)

## Requirements

1. Anaconda python distribution (or any other python 3.7 distribution)
2. Environment _mutations_ can be created with all the requirements with the following command:

    `conda env create -f environment.yml`
  
3. All necessary python packages are also listed in the PDF file
